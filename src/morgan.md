self-introduction:
 ```
My name is Zouchenfeng and I come from Jiangsu wuxi.I am now studying in Northwestern Polytechnical University for a master of control engineering. 
What i am sklled in is mainly Java, MySQL and Redis.

During my studying, i tried two projects. 
The first is a personal blog website. 
I used sping framework, sql and redis in this project. 
I implemented an unrepeatable thumbs-up function by redis.

The second project is a simple RPC framework using netty and zookeeper.Zookeeper is used as a registration center.

In life, I am creative and have a lot of energy. I think I am qualified for the job.

```

Why should we have you? Why should we give you an offer？
```
I think i am creative and i have a lot of energy.
I have solid basic knowledge and i like coding.
I am not afraid of difficulties and want to solve them.

```

What do you know to reduce the resource cost?
```
Improve resource utilization rate.
```

What are your strengths？
```
Strong self-study ability. The courage to challenge difficulties,
I think i am creative and i have a lot of energy.
```

object-oriented:
```
package, inheritance and polymorphism.
when we write code, data structure will be in object and if we modify the data structure, 
the whole project will not be influenced.
```

Singleton pattern:
```
The singleton pattern is to let a class be instantiated only once.
There is only one instance in memory, which saves memory consumption.
```

LinkedList ArrayList:
```
LinkedList and ArrayList are two different implementations of the List interface. LinkedList implements it with a doubly-linked list. ArrayList implements it with a dynamically re-sizing array.
```

process and thread:
```
Process is a heavy weight process.Context switch between the process is time consuming.

Threads are light weight processes.Threads are bundled inside the process.
Threads have a shared memory,data,resources,files.
Context switch between the threads are not much time consuming as Process.
```

thread pool:
```
What is thread pool?
Thread pool is to create several executable threads and put them into a pool. 
When a task needs to be processed, it will be submitted to the task queue in the thread pool. 
After processing, the thread will not be destroyed, but still wait for the next task in the thread pool.

why need thread poool?
Thread pool helps us manage threads. It can avoid frequently new threads and recycle threads. So it reduces the overhead.

what kind of thread pool?
there are some preset thread pools, like newSingleThreadExecutor , newFixedThreadPool,newScheduledThreadPool. Of course, we can use sing a custom thread pool.

```

garbage collection & jvm
```
gc happens in heap.In the yong generation, jvm use copying collector to collect the garbage.
if an object is still alive after seceral times of gc, it well be sent to the old generation.
gc in old generation called full gc.It takes more time. 
```

tcp & udp
```
tcp is connection-oriented and udp is connectionless.
udp does not guarantee data recovery and error-checking services.
```

Database index
```
Innodb use Clustering index .the leaf node store the data. 
combined index follows the leftmost matching principle.

```

Database transaction
```
Database transaction follows the ACID， it means a transaction is Atomic,Consistency,Isolation,Durability.

MYSQL standard defines four isolation levels, Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable.
```
